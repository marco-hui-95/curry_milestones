Project: Stephen Curry's Milestone

Introduction:

	As someone who loves playing basketball and occasionally watches the NBA, I have always been fascinated by the impact that certain players can have on the game. Stephen Curry is one such player who has completely changed the way basketball is played, with his incredible shooting and ball-handling skills. I wanted to learn more about Curry and his career, so I turned to data analysis. Using a dataset updated on 1st Feb, 2023 I found on Kaggle, I used SQL to explore various aspects of Curry's performance, from his shooting to his contributions to his team. Through this project, I hoped to gain a deeper understanding of what makes Curry such an amazing player.

Project Overview:

The project includes several SQL queries that were written to investigate various aspects of Curry's career. These queries were grouped into different topics:

	1. overview.sql: This query displays the first 5 rows of all tables related to Curry and his team.

	2. data_cleaning.sql: This query checks for null values and duplicates in the data and cleans them if needed.

	3. curry_rookie.sql: This query investigates Curry's performance in his first few years while Monta Ellis was his partner.

	4. curry_shooting.sql: This query studies Curry's shooting performance, including attempted and made 2 and 3 pointers, to see if there is a trend in how his performance has evolved over time.

	5. curry_gsw.sql: This query examines how much Curry has contributed to his team's success.

	6. curry_achievement.sql: This query compares Curry's shooting performance to all other players and measures his greatness.

Overall, the queries provide a comprehensive analysis of Stephen Curry's career, from his early years to his current achievements. The results of the queries demonstrate his exceptional skill and contribution to the game.

Further Studies:

	In the future, there are many possibilities for further exploration of this dataset. While my queries have focused on Curry's shooting performance, there are many other aspects of his game that can be explored using this dataset. As a talented point guard, his assists and ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates are also worth studying. Additionally, his defensive skills - including rebounding, steals, and blocks - are critical to his success as a player. By analyzing these different facets of his game, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of Curry's impact on the court. Another direction could be to compare Curry's performance to other NBA players in different eras to see how he stacks up against other greats. Overall, there is much to discover and learn from this rich dataset, and I am excited to continue exploring and analyzing it in the future.
